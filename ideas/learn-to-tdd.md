# Learn to TDD

## Learn the basics

We have found that the best way to learn the basics of Test Driven Development is to watch a practitioner.

Some screencasts which allow you to do so:

* [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts)
* [Clean Coders](https://cleancoders.com/videos)

Alternatively, find a mentor willing to show you.

If that is not possible, then there are some books that are quite useful:

* Test Driven Development: By Example (Kent Beck)
* Test Driven Development (Jason Gorman, Codemanship) [PDF](http://www.codemanship.co.uk/tdd_jasongorman_codemanship.pdf)

## Okay I know the basics of TDD, what now?

After that, you'll be wanting to learn new techniques to strengthen your TDD technique.

A good book for that is:

* Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided By Tests (Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce)

In the end, you'll want to improve your software design knowledge to unlock the benefits of TDD.

## Practice

Ultimately, it's all about [practice](./practice-tdd.md).
